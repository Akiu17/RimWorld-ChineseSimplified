  <!-- EN: An open expanse dominated by tall grasses. These areas are good for farming and ranching, except when there's a drought. The lack of trees and other vegetation means there's always a steady breeze. Steam geysers never appear here due to low geothermal activity. -->
  <Grasslands.description>一片由高大草丛主导的开阔地带。除了干旱时，这片地区非常适合耕种和放牧。由于缺少树木和其他植被，这里总是微风不断。由于地热活动较低，蒸汽间歇泉从未在此出现。</Grasslands.description>
