  <!-- EN: Your gravship sits docked at the orbital relay. As your crew begins to salvage the equipment, you realize that this isn't ancient human tech - it's a mechanoid beacon. The relay crackles to life and broadcasts its war alert to a distant mechhive. They're hunting you now, and they will eventually find you wherever you go.\n\nNote: This is a difficult scenario and is not recommended for new players. -->
