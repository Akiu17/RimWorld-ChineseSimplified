  <!-- EN: Engineered for life among the stars, starjack are built to withstand the unforgiving conditions of deep space living. Their reflective pressure-adaptive skin provides insulation against extreme temperatures and allows them to survive brief exposure to hard vacuum. These adaptations make them invaluable for spacewalk repairs and emergency decompression scenarios.\n\nMost starjack spend their lives beyond planetary gravity, leading to lower muscle mass and reduced physical strength compared to baseline humans. However, their resilience in zero-gravity environments makes them essential for maintaining orbital platforms and working aboard long-haul vessels.\n\nAs one of humanity's oldest xenotypes, starjack played a crucial role in the colonization of space. They are a common sight on deep-space stations and interstellar ships, where genetic modification is often a more cost-effective solution than upgrading spacecraft to support unaltered human physiology. -->
  <Starjack.description>星旅种被设计为星际旅行者，能够承受严酷的深空环境。其反射性压力自适应皮肤兼具极端温度隔离与短暂真空暴露生存能力。此类适应性使其成为太空行走维修与舱室失压应急处置的关键力量。\n\n因常年脱离行星重力，星旅种肌肉量普遍低于普通智人，躯体力量较弱。不过其在零重力环境下的卓越韧性，使其成为轨道设施维保与深空长途舰船运作的中坚力量。\n\n作为最古老的异种人之一，星旅种在太空殖民史中扮演重要角色。深空空间站与星际舰船上常见其身影，皆因改造人类基因比升级飞船以适配原始生理机能更具成本效益。</Starjack.description>
